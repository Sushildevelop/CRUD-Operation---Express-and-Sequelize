CRUD Operations with Express.js and Sequelize ORM

This project demonstrates how to implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a Node.js application using Express.js for handling API routes and Sequelize as the ORM for database interactions.

Technologies Used:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment

Express.js: Web framework for Node.js

Sequelize ORM: An ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for Node.js supporting multiple SQL databases

MySQL 

Features:
Create: Add new records to the database.

Read: Fetch single or multiple records from the database.

Update: Modify existing records.

Delete: Remove records from the database.

Each operation is exposed via a RESTful API endpoint following standard HTTP methods:

Operation	HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
Create	POST	/items	Create a new item
Read All	GET	/items	Retrieve all items
Read One	GET	/items/:id	Retrieve a single item by ID
Update	PUT	/items/:id	Update an item by ID
Delete	DELETE	/items/:id	Delete an item by ID
Project Structure:
bash

/models      -> Sequelize models
/controllers -> CRUD logic
/routes      -> Express route handlers
/app.js      -> Application entry point
Setup Instructions:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Configure your database in the config/config.json or .env file.

Run database migrations (optional):

bash
Copy
Edit
npx sequelize db:migrate
Start the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Notes:
Sequelize models are used to interact with the database tables.

Sequelize provides easy methods like create(), findAll(), findOne(), update(), and destroy().

Error handling and validations are implemented for clean API responses.
